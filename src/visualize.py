visualize.py - Spatial Data Visualization Module

This module creates dynamic visualizations of spatial data and diagnostic results.
It transforms complex geospatial analysis into accessible visual representations
that communicate territorial patterns, tensions, and opportunities.

Purpose:
    - Generate interactive and static maps
    - Visualize spatial patterns and relationships
    - Create temporal animations showing spatial dynamics
    - Produce diagnostic visualizations highlighting tensions
    - Support storytelling through spatial narratives
    - Enable participatory visualization for community engagement

Visualizations integrate the three dimensions of space (perceived/physical,
conceived/human, lived/symbolic) as defined in the GEO 2026 framework.

def create_visualization(data):
    """
    Create visualizations from spatial data and analysis results.
    
    This is a placeholder function that will be expanded to generate various
    types of spatial visualizations including maps, charts, and interactive displays.
    
    Args:
        data: Spatial data or analysis results to be visualized.
              Will support multiple data types including GeoDataFrames,
              diagnostic outputs, and temporal datasets.
    
    Returns:
        Currently prints a placeholder message. Will return visualization objects
        (e.g., matplotlib figures, folium maps, plotly interactive charts).
    
    Future Implementation:
        - Generate choropleth maps for spatial distributions
        - Create network visualizations for connectivity analysis
        - Produce temporal animations of spatial changes
        - Design interactive dashboards for exploration
        - Export visualizations in multiple formats (PNG, HTML, PDF)
