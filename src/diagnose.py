diagnose.py - Spatial Diagnostics and Analysis Module

This module provides diagnostic capabilities for analyzing spatial data and identifying
tensions, conflicts, inequalities, and patterns within territorial systems. It implements
the diagnostic component of the GEO 2026 Ecosystem methodology.

Purpose:
    - Identify spatial tensions and conflicts
    - Detect patterns of inequality and access disparities
    - Analyze relationships between physical, human, and symbolic dimensions
    - Generate diagnostic reports highlighting critical issues
    - Support evidence-based territorial planning and decision-making

The diagnostics align with the ethical framework of spatial justice, inclusion,
and sustainability promoted by the GEO 2026 Ecosystem.

    Analyze spatial data to diagnose tensions, patterns, and critical issues.
    
    This is a placeholder function that will be expanded to perform comprehensive
    spatial diagnostics across multiple dimensions of territorial analysis.
    
    Args:
        input_data: Spatial data to be analyzed. Format will be standardized
                   in future implementations (e.g., processed GeoDataFrame,
                   spatial objects with attributes and geometries).
    
    Returns:
        Currently prints a placeholder message. Will return diagnostic results
        including identified tensions, patterns, and recommendations.
    
    Future Implementation:
        - Detect spatial inequalities and access gaps
        - Identify risk zones and vulnerable areas
        - Analyze temporal patterns and emerging dynamics
        - Generate actionable diagnostic reports
        - Visualize tension points and conflict zones
